            <p>Unlike some other staple Indian breads, which are unleavened and crafted from durum wheat flour, or atta,
                fluffy naan is made with all-purpose flour and yeast. Traditionally, the dough is slapped against the
                chimney wall of a clay tandoor oven and baked over wood fires, but many home cooks make it on the
                stovetop. It is best savored hot and slathered with ghee. This recipe first appeared in the tablet
                edition of our August/September 2014 special India issue</p>

            <ol class="list">
                <li>Stir water and honey in a bowl; add yeast and let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add flour,
                    yogurt,
                    oil, and salt; stir until dough forms. Using hands, knead dough in bowl until smooth, about 5
                    minutes.
                    Cover dough with a damp cloth; let sit in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. </li>
                <li>Transfer dough to a work surface; divide into 10 balls. Working with 1 ball at a time and using a
                    rolling pin, roll dough into a 7″ circle about 1⁄4” thick. Sprinkle with 1⁄4 tsp. cilantro; press
                    into
                    dough. </li>
                <li> Heat a 12″ nonstick skillet over medium-high. Working with 1 piece dough at a time, cook dough,
                    plain
                    side down, until bubbles appear over the surface, about 45 seconds. Flip dough; cook until bubbles
                    appear once more, about 30 seconds. Transfer naan to a plate and slide skillet off heat. Using
                    tongs,
                    cook naan about 2″ over the open flame, flipping once, until browned in spots, about 1 minute.
